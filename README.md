Computer Vision
About the Project
Leaffliction is a comprehensive computer vision project aimed at analyzing plant health through dataset analysis, augmentation, image transformation, and disease classification. This project provides a robust pipeline to handle and preprocess image datasets, apply advanced image augmentations, and build a high-accuracy machine learning model for plant disease detection.

Key Features
Dataset Analysis:

Extract and visualize image distributions with pie charts and bar graphs.
Automatically adapt column names based on directory structure.
Data Augmentation:

Enhance dataset balance using techniques such as flipping, rotation, skewing, and cropping.
Save augmented images with descriptive filenames.
Image Transformation:

Implement advanced image-processing techniques, including Gaussian blur, object analysis, pseudolandmarks, and color histograms.
Plant Disease Classification:

Train a machine learning model with an accuracy of over 90% on the validation set.
Predict leaf diseases with clear visual outputs and detailed classifications.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML)
Data Processing Tools: PlantCV, Scikit-Image
