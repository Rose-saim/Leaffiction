An image histogram is a graphical representation of the number
of pixels in an image as a function of their intensity.

An histogram is a graph showing the number of pixels in an image
at each different intensity value found in that image.
Histograms are made up of bins, each bin representing
a certain intensity value range.
The histogram is computed by examining all pixels in the image
and assigning each
to a bin depending on the pixel intensity. The final value of a bin
is the number
of pixels assigned to it. The number of bins in which the whole
intensity range is divided is usually in the order of the square
root of the number of pixels.

Image histograms are an important tool for inspecting images.
They allow you to spot BackGround (Background is any additive
and approximately constant signal in your image that is not coming
from the objects you are interested in.
Background might come from for example an electronic offset
in your detector or from indirect light) and grey value range
at a glance.

    # from 0 to 360 degrees (0° for red, 120° for green, 240° for blue,

    # A saturation of 0% results in a gray tone, while 100% is a
    # fully saturated color.

    # Value (V): Represents the overall brightness of the color,
    # ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white).
